# Cottleston Pie
A simple website for a tiny agency in a big city.

## High Level Goals
* Make it clear what type of work Cottleston Pie does
  * Cottleston Pie creates websites for organizations making a positive impact
* Highlight projects that weâ€™re proud of
* Make it easier to understand what kind of work we do
* Give highlighted projects more context
* Explain how Cottleston Pie works with partners

* Layout Goals
* KISS
* Visually display projects in a way that shows off the wide variety of projects we've worked on
* Keep the branding that exists now, but build out the rest of the system.
* Refine the type usage

## Technical Goals
* Responsive (duh)
* Mobile first CSS
* Static pages (maybe straight HTML, depending on how deep the site becomes, otherwise probably Siteleaf)
* Use SVG when available
* Use 2x images otherwise
